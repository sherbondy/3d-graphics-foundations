I am working through this wonderful book: [Foundations of 3D Computer Graphics](http://www.3dgraphicsfoundations.com/).

The idea is to go through each assignment in C++ and WebGL, extending it as I see fit for fun and edification.

Took a graphics class during undergrad, but we did not use modern techniques (GLSL), so this will both reinforce what I learned and give me a solid grounding. And porting to WebGL will be a blast.

To get going on Mac OSX 10.9, I had to:

```
brew install glew
```
